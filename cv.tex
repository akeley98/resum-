\myTitle{Work Experience}

\mySub{Sholari LLC -- July - September 2019 -- Contractor}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Worked on a Unity 3D game that simulates tumor growth and
  provides visualizations of tumor response to various treatment
  options.
\item Implemented line graphs, waterfall (bar) plots, and the user
  interface for the timeline (graph x-axis).
\item Wrote a multithreaded \texttt{C++11} plugin for visualizing
  tumors \& immune system responses as particle clouds, and integrated
  it with the single-threaded \texttt{C\#} Unity Engine.
\end{enumerate}

\mySub{Stanford Aetherling Project -- June - September 2018 --
  Research Assistant}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Aetherling supports automatic parallelization and static
  scheduling\footnote{i.e. not using ready-valid hardware interfaces.}
  of hardware image processing pipelines designed using a
  Haskell-embedded domain-specific language.
\item Contributed to the functional simulator of an early prototype of
  Aetherling and worked to remove impediments to parallelizing the
  prototype's line buffers.\footnote{A line buffer device reads in an
    image as a stream of pixel values and outputs rectangular portions
    (``windows'') of the image.}
\item Collaborated with David Durst (lead author), Dr. Kayvon
  Fatahalian, and Dr. Pat Hanrahan.
\end{enumerate}

\web{https://github.com/David-Durst/aetherlingHaskellIR} (early prototype)

\mySub{MediocrePy -- March - June 2017 -- Independent Project}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Created an optimized library for reducing stacks of telescope
  images to a single image using pixel means or medians and optional
  outlier rejection (sigma clipping) for noise reduction.
\item Multithreaded C core with AVX vectorization; C and Python
  (numpy) interface. Decreased runtime (compared to the Python
  implementation replaced) from hours to milliseconds.
\item Collaborated with Dr. Zheng Cai, UC Santa Cruz Astrophysics.
\end{enumerate}
\web{https://github.com/akeley98/MediocrePy}

\mySub{Tsinghua Astrophysics -- July - August 2016 -- Summer Intern}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Designed a library for fitting and plotting standard
  microlensing event light curves given a set of brightness
  data for a star.
\item Used Python, C++, SciPy, Matplotlib.
\item Collaborated with Dr. Shude Mao.
\end{enumerate}

\mySub{Jide Technology Co. -- June - July 2015 -- Summer Intern}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Product testing for RemixOS, an Android derivative with a
  desktop-like interface.

\item Wrote international marketing \& documentation in English.

\item Collaborated with Jason Zheng and Jeff Zhao (International
  Marketing Manager).
\end{enumerate}

\mySub{WebGL Jelly Cube Project}

Simple mass-spring system simulation written with Javascript,
WebAssembly, and WebGL 2.0 (for refractive and reflective effects).
Earned third place in the UCLA computer graphics class contest, Fall
2017.\footnote{

\mySub{DementedIGPU -- Linux Nvidia Setup Script}

(Unfortunately, this project no longer works due to Bumblebee's
end-of-support).

Laptops with Nvidia graphics cards often work unreliably with the
GNU/Linux operating system, especially when attempting to switch
between high-performance discrete graphics and low-power integrated
graphics. I wrote a Python 3 script that automatically installs and
configures software needed to provide a (relatively) reliable option
at boot time between high- and low-power graphics.\footnote{This
  automation depends on the user using a system with \texttt{apt},
  \texttt{systemd}, and the \texttt{GRUB} bootloader. Tested with
  Ubuntu 18.04.} I documented the script liberally in order to make it
as beginner-friendly as a command line application can be.

\mySub{Myricube -- Experimental OpenGL Voxel Renderer (WIP)}

This experiment in hybrid raycast/mesh voxel renderering was inspired
by my discontent with Minecraft's low render distance, even on high
settings.

Conventional voxel renderers such as Minecraft's work by converting
voxel models into a mesh of triangles to draw, possibly with some
optimizations like hidden face removal or merging coplanar
triangles. This uses the GPU for its designed purpose, but as render
distance increases, the GPU is bottlenecked by the large number of
small triangles generated. Myricube uses conventional mesh rendering
for nearby voxels but draws more distant voxels with an alternative
raycasting renderer. This renderer subdivides the voxel model into
cubic chunks, computes a minimal AABB\footnote{axis alligned bounding
  box} for each chunk's visible voxels, and draws the AABBs themselves
with a raycasting fragment shader that only checks for intersections
within the drawn AABB.  Dividing the model into AABBs reduces my
renderer's memory bandwidth requirements and time wasted raycasting
through empty space, compared to a conventional raycasting renderer.

\mySub{Proposed gem5 Hardware Simulator Partial Bypassing Patch}

This patch is a refactoring of the \texttt{C++} code I wrote as part
of my UCLA ``Advanced Computer Architecture'' course project.

In an out-of-order CPU, hardware bypassing allows instructions stalled
waiting for a register to start execution as soon as the functional
unit (ALU, memory port, etc.) writing to said register completes,
without waiting for the actual commitment to register file. This is
crucial for performance, so mainline \texttt{gem5} simulates complete
bypassing between all functional units in the simulated CPU. However,
this is not practical to realize in modern superscalar hardware, as
bypassing costs grow quadratically with the number of functional
units. My patch splits the CPU's functional units into separate pools,
with bypassing simulated only between pools. The
commit-to-register-file delay is imposed for values communicated
between pools.

Although the patch received positive code reviews, it doesn't look
like there's enough interest in the feature to actually merge it into
mainline \texttt{gem5}.
